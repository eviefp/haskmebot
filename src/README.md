## Done

- `!command add <key> <text ...>`
- `!key`
- persisting commands across runs
- read token from environment
    - re-generate oauth token

## In-Progress

## PLAN
- API-level commands, like:
!starttime <hour>
would do some
http post <url>/set-hour <hour>

- use real data format instead of show/read
